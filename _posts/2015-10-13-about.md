Hi! My name is Elliot Schultz and I am an animator and digital artist living in Melbourne, Australia.

I recently graduated from the [ANU School of Art][0] with a Bachelor of Digital Art and have studied animation as an exchange student at the [Rhode Island School of Design][1].

These days you'll find me working as a interaction designer with[ED.][2]and making sweet animations on the side.
